## Important Considerations for Production Environment

<details>
  <summary>Private Network Configuration</summary>

 > For enhanced security, consider configuring your Azure resources to operate within a private network. This can be achieved using Azure Virtual Network (VNet) to isolate your resources and control inbound and outbound traffic. Implementing private endpoints for services like Azure Blob Storage and Azure Functions can further secure your data by restricting access to your VNet.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Security</summary>

  > Ensure that you implement appropriate security measures when deploying this solution in a production environment. This includes: <br/>
  >
  > - Securing Access: Use Azure Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory or Azure AD) for authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions. <br/>
  > - Managing Secrets: Store sensitive information such as connection strings and API keys in Azure Key Vault. <br/>
  > - Data Encryption: Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Scalability</summary>

  > While this example provides a basic setup, you may need to scale the resources based on your specific requirements. Azure services offer various scaling options to handle increased workloads. Consider using: <br/>
  >
  > - Auto-scaling: Configure auto-scaling for Azure Functions and other services to automatically adjust based on demand. <br/>
  > - Load Balancing: Use Azure Load Balancer or Application Gateway to distribute traffic and ensure high availability.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Cost Management</summary>

  > Monitor and manage the costs associated with your Azure resources. Use Azure Cost Management and Billing to track usage and optimize resource allocation.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Compliance</summary>

  > Ensure that your deployment complies with relevant regulations and standards. Use Azure Policy to enforce compliance and governance policies across your resources.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Disaster Recovery</summary>
   
> Implement a disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity in case of failures. Use Azure Site Recovery and backup solutions to protect your data and applications.

</details>

## Overview

Proceed with the configuration from [Configure/Validate the Environment variables](#configurevalidate-the-environment-variables).
       
## Step 1: Set Up Your Azure Environment

> An Azure `Resource Group` is a `container that holds related resources for an Azure solution`.
> It can include all the resources for the solution or only those you want to manage as a group.
> Typically, resources that share the same lifecycle are added to the same resource group, allowing for easier deployment, updating, and deletion as a unit.
> Resource groups also store metadata about the resources, and you can apply access control, locks, and tags to them for better management and organization.

1. **Create an Azure Account**: If you don't have one, sign up for an Azure account.
2. **Create a Resource Group**:
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to **Resource groups**.
   - Click **+ Create**.

       <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56d1e99f-0a22-4492-bd6f-d4e3a76aedd8">

## Step 2: Set Up Azure Blob Storage for PDF Ingestion

### Create a Storage Account

> An `Azure Storage Account` provides a `unique namespace in Azure for your data, allowing you to store and manage various types of data such as blobs, files, queues, and tables`. It serves as the foundation for all Azure Storage services, ensuring high availability, scalability, and security for your data. <br/> <br/>

- In the Azure portal, navigate to your **Resource Group**.
- Click **+ Create**.

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1998660c-bb80-4ea7-9865-b6cdfa125d02">

- Search for `Storage Account`.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bde893e-a40e-4dd6-bf55-964c33109e33">

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a168a63b-2d15-4643-8200-34bf8335a0fe">

### Create a Blob Container

> A `Blob Container` is a `logical grouping of blobs within an Azure Storage Account, similar to a directory in a file system`. Containers help organize and manage blobs, which can be any type of unstructured data like text or binary data. Each container can store an unlimited number of blobs, and you must create a container before uploading any blobs.

Within the Storage Account, create a Blob Container to store your PDFs.

- Go to your Storage Account.
- Under **Data storage**, select **Containers**.
- Click **+ Container**.
- Enter a name for the container (e.g., `pdfinvoices`) and set the public access level to **Private**.
- Click **Create**.

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27b024f8-0390-4331-bc34-59c3831d9bd1">

### Allow storage account key access

> If you plan to use access keys, please ensure that the setting "Allow storage account key access" is enabled. When this setting is disabled, any requests to the account authorized with Shared Key, including shared access signatures (SAS), will be denied. Click [here to learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/shared-key-authorization-prevent?tabs=portal)

<img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47e74073-1b58-4d4a-b898-7be91b9314b7">

## Step 3: Set Up Azure Cosmos DB

### Create a Cosmos DB Account

> `Azure Cosmos DB` is a globally distributed,`multi-model database service provided by Microsoft Azure`. It is designed to offer high availability, scalability, and low-latency access to data for modern applications. Unlike traditional relational databases, Cosmos DB is a `NoSQL database, meaning it can handle unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data types`. `It supports multiple data models, including document, key-value, graph, and column-family, making it versatile for various use cases.` <br/> <br/>

- In the Azure portal, navigate to your **Resource Group**.
- Click **+ Create**.
- Search for `Cosmos DB`, click on `Create`:
  
   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecdb9a17-5623-4dc0-a607-92448950b7a0">

- Choose your desired API type, for this will be using `Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL`. This option supports a SQL-like query language, which is familiar and powerful for querying and analyzing your invoice data. It also integrates well with various client libraries, making development easier and more flexible.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db942359-8a81-4289-9ea7-91234b4c3802">

- Please enter an account name (e.g., `contosoinvoiceaicosmos`). As with the previously configured resources, we will use the `Public network` for this example. Ensure that you adjust the architecture to include your networking requirements.
- Select the region and other settings.
- Click **Review + create** and then **Create**.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47948255-3988-42f3-8e4e-80291aefaf5b">

### Create a Database and Container

> An `Azure Cosmos DB container` is a `logical unit` within a Cosmos DB database where data is stored. `Containers are schema-agnostic, meaning they can store items with different structures. Each container is automatically partitioned to scale out across multiple servers, providing virtually unlimited throughput and storage`. Containers are the primary scalability unit in Cosmos DB, and they use a partition key to distribute data efficiently across partitions.

- Go to your Cosmos DB account.
- Under **Data Explorer**, click **New Database**.

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0130cf2-aaf8-4a63-9786-4c65bc700812">

- Enter a database name (e.g., `ContosoDBDocIntellig`) and click **OK**.

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7839be4d-8d4d-476e-9d81-203b0fd2426f">

- Click **New Container**.

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24e08dca-3399-40d2-a91d-95a6569156ad">

- Enter a container name (e.g., `Invoices`) and set the partition key (e.g., `/transactionId`).
- Click **OK**.

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96ffc93a-078b-49f9-ad4a-470e73540c30">

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/203f4e0d-6697-4200-83bc-65f0023addb5">

## Step 4: Set Up Azure Document Intelligence

> `Azure Document Intelligence` offers robust capabilities for `extracting structured data from various document types using advanced machine learning models`. Technically, it provides `prebuilt models` for `common documents like invoices, receipts, and business cards, which can quickly extract key information without custom training. For more specific needs`, it allows `training custom models using labeled data, enabling precise extraction tailored to unique document formats`. The service is accessible via `REST APIs and SDKs` in multiple languages, facilitating seamless integration into applications. It supports `key-value pair extraction`, `table recognition`, and `text extraction`, making it a powerful tool for automating data entry, enhancing document management systems, and streamlining business processes.

### Create Document Intelligence Resource

  #### Training Custom Models (optional/if needed)

- **Prepare Training Data**:
  - Collect a set of sample documents similar to your PDF example.
  - Label the fields you want to extract using the [Form Recognizer Labeling Tool](https://fott-2-1.azurewebsites.net/). Click [here for more information about to use it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/v21/try-sample-label-tool?view=doc-intel-2.1.0#prerequisites-for-training-a-custom-form-model).

      <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94fca855-ec1b-444c-91f0-e05de13600df">

- **Upload Training Data**: Upload the labeled documents to an Azure Blob Storage container.
- Grant the necessary role (`Storage Blob Data Reader`) to the Document Intelligence Account for the Storage Account to access the information. Otherwise, you may encounter an error like this:

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16feb31b-2a0e-4060-8e57-c870240a5109">

  - For this example we'll be using the system assigned identity to do that. Under `Identy` within your `Document Intelligence Account`, change the status to `On`, and click on `Save`:

      > A system assigned managed identity is restricted to `one per resource and is tied to the lifecycle of this resource`. `You can grant permissions to the managed identity by using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The managed identity is authenticated with Microsoft Entra ID, so you don’t have to store any credentials in code`.

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4be26e42-b9d4-4f04-ae5e-e8e6babd9366">

  - Go to your `Storage Account`, under `Access Control (IAM)` click on `+ Add`, and then `Add role assigment`:

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59881d40-eb4c-4276-b3d3-d5e7dd877af0">

  - Search for `Storage Blob Data Reader`, click `Next`. Then, click on `select members` and search for your `Document intelligence identity`. Finally click on `Review + assign`:

      <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8bbe706-8ecc-41bd-a189-846e82ccef01">

- In the Form Recognizer Studio, select `Custom extraction model`.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61c190d3-f795-4ac6-ab73-73e7e83b9dcc">

- Scroll down, and click on `Create a project` (e.g, `pdfinvoiceproject`, `Extract information from pdf invoices`):

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d8eb2f1-a05e-47ca-b7a0-0f850a093e5f">

- Configure the service resource for the project, choose `subscription`, `resource group`, `Document Intelligence or Cognitive Service Resource` and the `api version`.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a100714-844e-4a2a-a875-c50da88bc889">

- Connect training data source: Provide the information of the Azure Blob Storage account and the folder that contains your training data.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f15a9908-8710-4a3e-a457-8d557c8f2f48">

- You can also `Auto label` if it's required:

- **Test the Model**:
  - Upload a new document to test the custom model.
  - Verify that the model correctly extracts the desired fields.

## Step 5: Set Up Azure Functions for Document Ingestion and Processing

> An `Azure Function App` is a `container for hosting individual Azure Functions`. It provides the execution context for your functions, allowing you to manage, deploy, and scale them together. `Each function app can host multiple functions, which are small pieces of code that run in response to various triggers or events, such as HTTP requests, timers, or messages from other Azure services`. <br/> <br/>
> Azure Functions are designed to be lightweight and event-driven, enabling you to build scalable and serverless applications. `You only pay for the resources your functions consume while they are running, making it a cost-effective solution for many scenarios`.

### Create a Function App

- In the Azure portal, go to your **Resource Group**.
- Click **+ Create**.

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7796ccf9-808d-487a-85cc-ec8bc382a7aa">

- Search for `Function App`, click on `Create`:

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c5ce746-06b7-4dd8-992f-edc597ea6c27">

- Choose a `hosting option`; for this example, we will use `Functions Premium`. Click [here for a quick overview of hosting options](#function-app-hosting-options):
        
     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11fabed8-1219-4090-9ba8-a79a41f2830a">

- Enter a name for the Function App (e.g., `ContosoFAaiDocIntellig`).
- Choose your runtime stack (e.g., `.NET` or `Python`).
- Select the region and other settings.

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e5dbc3c-6ee9-4272-95d4-243c7cca68d9">

- Select **Review + create** and then **Create**. Verify the resources created in your `Resource Group`.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/002620d0-4040-4289-ad56-3e5d4d6ff3c7">

 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > This example is using system-assigned managed identity to assign RBACs (Role-based Access Control).
 > <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46fe06d4-d978-4743-801d-59c197fa4717">

- Please assign the `Storage Blob Data Contributor` and `Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor` roles to the `Function App` within the `Storage Account` related to the runtime (the one created with the function app).

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a08f77bf-71d4-4922-8001-cf402e9e81f2">

- Assign `Storage Blob Data Reader` to the `Function App` within the `Storage Account` that will contains the invoices, click `Next`. Then, click on `select members` and search for your `Function App` identity. Finally click on `Review + assign`:

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcfdd7f0-f7a6-4829-876a-87383887e0e2">

- Also add `Cosmos DB Operator`, `DocumentDB Account Contributor`, `Azure AI Administrator`, `Cosmos DB Account Reader Role`, `Contributor` to the `Function App` within the `Cosmos DB`:

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7570747e-a5f1-4090-98ce-b44928ef1f57">

- To assign the `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/readMetadata` permission, you need to create a custom role in Azure Cosmos DB. This permission is required for accessing metadata in Cosmos DB. Click [here to understand more about it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/security/how-to-grant-data-plane-role-based-access?tabs=built-in-definition%2Ccsharp&pivots=azure-interface-cli#prepare-role-definition).

    | **Aspect**         | **Data Plane Access**                                                                 | **Control Plane Access**                                                                 |
    |--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Scope**          | Focuses on `data operations` within databases and containers.

> Steps to assing it:

1. **Open Azure CLI**: Go to the [Azure portal](portal.azure.com) and click on the icon for the Azure CLI.

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2643d9a-7364-454a-bb24-f16270e99d92">

2. **List Role Definitions**: Run the following command to list all of the role definitions associated with your Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account. Review the output and locate the role definition named `Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor`.

     ```powershell
     az cosmosdb sql role definition list \
         --resource-group "<your-resource-group>" \
         --account-name "<your-account-name>"
     ```
    
    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c19d70e-d525-4c15-bb0e-518f50f61b37">
    
3. **Get Cosmos DB Account ID**: Run this command to get the ID of your Cosmos DB account. Record the value of the `id` property as it is required for the next step.

     ```powershell
     az cosmosdb show --resource-group "<your-resource-group>" --name "<your-account-name>" --query "{id:id}"
     ```

     Example output:
    
     ```json
    {                                                               
      "id": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/{cosmos-account-name}"
    }     
     ```
    
     <img width="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3426130-2de5-46a0-96f0-4c6e15e57975">

4. **Assign the Role**: Assign the new role using `az cosmosdb sql role assignment create`. Use the previously recorded role definition ID for the `--role-definition-id` argument, the unique identifier for your identity for the `--principal-id` argument, and your `account's ID and the Function App` for the `--scope` argument. You need to do this for both the Function App to read metadata from Cosmos DB and your ID to access and view the information.

     > You can extract the `principal-id`, from `Identity` of the `Function App`:
    
      <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b54f046f-ecc7-4434-80ce-e49a0abeca66">
    
     ```powershell
     az cosmosdb sql role assignment create \
         --resource-group "<your-resource-group>" \
         --account-name "<your-account-name>" \
         --role-definition-id "<role-definition-id>" \
         --principal-id "<principal-id>" \
         --scope "/subscriptions/{subscriptions-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/{cosmos-account-name}"
     ```

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72e1e4f9-9228-4ec0-aade-20ad4aaa1f4f">
    
    > After a few minutes, you will see something like this:
    
    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5caea3b9-3e4d-4791-8376-fda4547547bd">

6. **Verify Role Assignment**: Use `az cosmosdb sql role assignment list` to list all role assignments for your Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account. Review the output to ensure your role assignment was created.
    
     ```powershell
     az cosmosdb sql role assignment list \
         --resource-group "<your-resource-group>" \
         --account-name "<your-account-name>"
     ```

### Develop the Function

- You need to install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install python from Microsoft store:
    
     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30f00c27-da0d-400f-9b98-817fd3e03b1c">

- Open VSCode, and install some extensions: `python`, and `Azure Tools`.

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/715449d3-1a36-4764-9b07-99421fb1c834">

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/854aa665-dc2f-4cbf-bae2-2dc0a8ef6e46">

- Click on the `Azure` icon, and `sign in` into your account. Allow the extension `Azure Resources` to sign in using Microsoft, it will open a browser window. After doing so, you will be able to see your subscription and resources.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4824ca1c-4959-4242-95af-ad7273c5530d">

- Under Workspace, click on `Create Function Project`, and choose a path in your local computer to develop your function.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c42d19e-be8b-48ef-a7e4-8a39989cea5a">

- Choose the language, in this case is `python`:

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fb19a1e-bb2d-47e5-a56e-8dc8a708647a">

- Select the model version, for this example let's use `v2`:
  
   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd46ee93-d788-463d-8b28-dbf2487e9a7f">

- For the python interpreter, let's use the one installed via `Microsoft Store`:

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3605c959-fc59-461f-9e8d-01a6a92004a8">

- Choose a template (e.g., **Blob trigger**) and configure it to trigger on new PDF uploads in your Blob container.

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a4ed541-a693-485c-b6ca-7d5fb55a61d2">

- Provide a function name, like `BlobTriggerContosoPDFInvoicesDocIntelligence`:

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/263cef5c-4460-46cb-8899-fb609b191d81">

- Next, it will prompt you for the path of the blob container where you expect the function to be triggered after a file is uploaded. In this case is `pdfinvoices` as was previously created.

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7005dc44-ffe2-442b-8373-554b229b3042">

- Click on `Create new local app settings`, and then choose your subscription.

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07c211d6-eda0-442b-b428-cdaed2bf12ac">

- Choose `Azure Storage Account for remote storage`, and select one. I'll be using the `invoicecontosostorage`. 

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b5865fc-3e84-4582-8f06-cb5675d393f0">

- Then click on `Open in the current window`. You will see something like this:

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f30e8e10-0c37-4efc-8158-c83faf22a7d8">

- Now we need to update the function code to extract data from PDFs and store it in Cosmos DB, use this an example:

   > 1. **PDF Upload**: A PDF is uploaded to the Azure Blob Storage container.
   > 2. **Trigger Azure Function**: The upload triggers the Azure Function `BlobTriggerContosoPDFInvoicesDocIntelligence`.
   > 3. **Initialize Clients**: Sets up connections to Document Intelligence and Cosmos DB. <br/>
   >       - The function initializes the `DocumentAnalysisClient` to interact with Azure Document Intelligence. <br/>
   >       - It also initializes the `CosmosClient` to interact with Cosmos DB. <br/>
   > 4. **Read PDF from Blob Storage**: The function reads the PDF content from the Blob Storage into a byte stream.
   > 5. **Analyze PDF**: Uses Document Intelligence to extract data. <br/>
   >      - The function calls the `begin_analyze_document` method of the `DocumentAnalysisClient` using the prebuilt invoice model to analyze the PDF. <br/>
   >      - It waits for the analysis to complete and retrieves the results. <br/>
   > 6. **Extract Data**: Structures the extracted data. <br/>
   >       - The function extracts relevant fields from the analysis result, such as customer name, email, address, company name, phone, address, and rental details. <br/>
   >       - It structures this extracted data into a dictionary (`invoice_data`). <br/>
   > 7. **Save Data to Cosmos DB**: Inserts the data into Cosmos DB. <br/>
   >       - The function calls `save_invoice_data_to_cosmos` to save the structured data into Cosmos DB. <br/>
   >       - It ensures the database and container exist, then inserts the extracted data. <br/>
   > 8. **Logging (process and errors)**: Throughout the process, the function logs various steps and any errors encountered for debugging and monitoring purposes.

  - Update the function_app.py:

      | Template Blob Trigger | Function Code updated |
